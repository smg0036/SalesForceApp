Test NG (advanced version of JUnit)
Framework development tool

provides annotations to control the test cases/methods
doesnt require main method to run a test case
Data providers
create grouping of test cases
can set priority of execution
can do certain actions based on events/listeeners(Pass, Fail, skip
can make assertions



creating reusable functions for the framework


priority in TestNG: lowest number to highest

minus values can also be included
- to +
no priority means default priority of 0.

if u have 2 test cases with same priority it will check alphabetic order of
method name(A to Z)(a to z) (CAPITAL 

 FIRST)

e.g: method name: Launch9(), Launch7()
Launch7 executes first

dependsOnMethods="method name"//waits for that method to get pass)

dependsOnMethods overrides the priority

enabled = false

By default all the meathods have enabled = true

@AfterMethod
public void loginApp()

@BeforeMethod
PUBLIC VOID logoutApp()

@Test(priority = 1, groups ={"Login", "Sanity"})

@BeforeMethod(onlyForGroups = "Login")


//It executes before start of any test cases in the class)
@BeforeClass(description="used to launch application before running test cases")

@AfterClass(alwaysRun=true)

gets executed before executing any of the groups
@BeforeGroups(dependsOnGroups=
@BeforeSuite
public void suitLevelPrecondition(){
}

@BeforeTest   //gets exeuted only once before test even if we have five different class
public void demo(){

Order:
-------
@BeforeSuite
@BeforeTest
@BeforeClass
@BeforeGroups
@BeforeMethod
@Test
@AfterMethod
@AfterGroups
@AfterClass
